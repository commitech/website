# Domain and Hosting Setup

We use [WebHostingHub](https://webhostinghub.com) as our website hosting. To maintain, login using "nussucommittech@gmail.com" as the email address. As this account manages the domain, we can't use "technical@nussucommit.com" for the login email address. 

## Payment

First of all, make sure that the fee will be billed to your credit card, not the previous Technical Head. Don't worry, it will be later reimbursed by the NUSSU commIT treasurer. To check this, hover "Billing" on the menu bar and then click "Manage Payment Method". If your credit card account is not there yet, then you should add it by clicking "+ Add New Credit Card". Fill in your account details and click "Save". If there is still someone's credit card account (not your account) there, click "View More/Edit" on the column on that name, and click "Delete" to make sure that the fee will no longer be billed to that account.
